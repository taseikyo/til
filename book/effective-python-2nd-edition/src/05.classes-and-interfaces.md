# 5. Classes and Interfaces

## Item 39: Use @classmethod Polymorphism to Construct Objects Generically

- Python only supports a single constructor per class: the __init__ method
- Use @classmethod to define alternative constructors for your classes
- Use class method polymorphism to provide generic ways to build and connect many concrete subclasses

## Item 40: Initialize Parent Classes with super

The old, simple way to initialize a parent class from a child class is to directly call the parent class’s __init__ method with the child instance:

```python
class MyBaseClass:
	def __init__(self, value):
		self.value = value

class MyChildClass(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self):
		MyBaseClass.__init__(self, 5)
```

If a class is affected by multiple inheritance , calling the superclasses’ __init__ methods directly can lead to unpredictable behavior

One problem is that the __init__ call order isn’t specified across all subclasses

```python
class TimesTwo:
	def __init__(self):
		self.value *= 2

class PlusFive:
	def __init__(self):
		self.value += 5

class OneWay(MyBaseClass, TimesTwo, PlusFive):
	def __init__(self, value):
		MyBaseClass.__init__(self, value)
		TimesTwo.__init__(self)
		PlusFive.__init__(self)

foo = OneWay(5)
print('First ordering value is (5 * 2) + 5 =', foo.value)

>>>
First ordering value is (5 * 2) + 5 = 15

class AnotherWay(MyBaseClass, PlusFive, TimesTwo):
	def __init__(self, value):
		MyBaseClass.__init__(self, value)
		TimesTwo.__init__(self)
		PlusFive.__init__(self)

bar = AnotherWay(5)
print('Second ordering value is', bar.value)

>>>
Second ordering value is 15
```

上面两个类继承顺序不同，最后结果却是相同，是直接调用父类 __init__ 函数带来的问题。

Another problem occurs with diamond inheritance. Diamond inheritance happens when a subclass inherits from two separate classes that have the same superclass somewhere in the hierarchy. Diamond inheritance causes the common superclass’s __init__ method to run multiple times, causing unexpected behavior

```python
class TimesSeven(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		MyBaseClass.__init__(self, value)
		self.value *= 7

class PlusNine(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		MyBaseClass.__init__(self, value)
		self.value += 9

class ThisWay(TimesSeven, PlusNine):
	def __init__(self, value):
		TimesSeven.__init__(self, value)
		PlusNine.__init__(self, value)

foo = ThisWay(5)
print('Should be (5 * 7) + 9 = 44 but is', foo.value)

>>>
Should be (5 * 7) + 9 = 44 but is 14
```

The call to the second parent class’s constructor, PlusNine.__init__, causes self.value to be reset back to 5 when MyBaseClass.__init__ gets called a second time

That results in the calculation of self.value to be 5 + 9 = 14, completely ignoring the effect of the TimesSeven.__init__ constructor

To solve these problems, Python has the `super` built-in function and standard `method resolution order (MRO)`

`super` ensures that common superclasses in diamond hierarchies are run only once 

The `MRO` defines the ordering in which superclasses are initialized, following an algorithm called C3 linearization

```python
class TimesSevenCorrect(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		super().__init__(value)
		self.value *= 7

class PlusNineCorrect(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		super().__init__(value)
		self.value += 9

class GoodWay(TimesSeven, PlusNine):
	def __init__(self, value):
		super().__init__(value)

foo = GoodWay(5)
print('Should be 7 * (5 + 9) = 98 and is', foo.value)

>>>
Should be 7 * (5 + 9) = 98 and is 98
```

This order may seem backward at first

Shouldn’t TimesSevenCorrect.__init__ have run first? Shouldn’t the result be (5 * 7) + 9 = 44? The answer is no

This ordering matches what the `MRO` defines for this class. The `MRO` ordering is available on a class method called `mro`:

```Markdown
mro_str = '\n'.join(repr(cls) for cls in GoodWay.mro())
print(mro_str)

>>>
<class '__main__.GoodWay'>
<class '__main__.TimesSevenCorrect'>
<class '__main__.PlusNineCorrect'>
<class '__main__.MyBaseClass'>
<class 'object'>
```

When I call GoodWay(5), it in turn calls TimesSevenCorrect.__init__, which calls PlusNineCorrect.__init__, which calls MyBaseClass.__ init__

Once this reaches the top of the diamond, all of the initialization methods actually do their work in the opposite order from how their __init__ functions were called

- MyBaseClass.__init__ assigns value to 5
- PlusNineCorrect.__init__ adds 9 to make value equal 14
- TimesSevenCorrect.__init__ multiplies it by 7 to make value equal 98

Besides making multiple inheritance robust, the call to super(). __init__ is also much more maintainable than calling MyBaseClass.__init__ directly from within the subclasses

I could later rename MyBaseClass to something else or have TimesSevenCorrect and PlusNineCorrect inherit from another superclass without having to update their __init__ methods to match

The super function can also be called with two parameters: first the type of the class whose MRO parent view you’re trying to access, and then the instance on which to access that view

```python
class ExplicitTrisect(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		super(ExplicitTrisect, self).__init__(value)
		self.value /= 3
```

these parameters are not required for object instance initialization. Python’s compiler automatically provides the correct parameters (__class__ and self) for you when super is called with zero arguments within a class definition

```python
class AutomaticTrisect(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		super(__class__, self).__init__(value)
		self.value /= 3

class ImplicitTrisect(MyBaseClass):
	def __init__(self, value):
		super().__init__(value)
		self.value /= 3

assert ExplicitTrisect(9).value == 3
assert AutomaticTrisect(9).value == 3
assert ImplicitTrisect(9).value == 3
```

上面三个对 super 的调用是等价的

- Python’s standard method resolution order (MRO) solves the problems of superclass initialization order and diamond inheritance
- Use the super built-in function with zero arguments to initialize parent classes

## Item 41: Consider Composing Functionality with Mix-in Classes

- Avoid using multiple inheritance with instance attributes and __init__ if mix-in classes can achieve the same outcome
- Use pluggable behaviors at the instance level to provide per-class customization when mix-in classes may require it
- Mix-ins can include instance methods or class methods, depending on your needs
- Compose mix-ins to create complex functionality from simple behaviors

## Item 42: Prefer Public Attributes Over Private Ones

一个下划线开头的变量表示为 protected；两个为 private

- Private attributes aren’t rigorously enforced by the Python compiler
- Plan from the beginning to allow subclasses to do more with your internal APIs and attributes instead of choosing to lock them out
- Use documentation of protected fields to guide subclasses instead of trying to force access control with private attributes
- Only consider using private attributes to avoid naming conflicts with subclasses that are out of your control

## Item 43: Inherit from collections.abc for Custom Container Types

```python
class FrequencyList(list):
	def __init__(self, members):
		super().__init__(members)

def frequency(self):
	counts = {}
	for item in self:
		counts[item] = counts.get(item, 0) + 1
	return counts

foo = FrequencyList(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd'])
print('Length is', len(foo))
foo.pop()
print('After pop:', repr(foo))
print('Frequency:', foo.frequency())

>>>
Length is 7
After pop: ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a']
Frequency: {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
```


```python
class IndexableNode(BinaryNode):
	def _traverse(self):
		if self.left is not None:
			yield from self.left._traverse()
		yield self
		if self.right is not None:
			yield from self.right._traverse()

	def __getitem__(self, index):
		for i, item in enumerate(self._traverse()):
			if i == index:
				return item.value
		raise IndexError(f'Index {index} is out of range')

class SequenceNode(IndexableNode):
	def __len__(self):
		for count, _ in enumerate(self._traverse(), 1):
			pass
		return count

tree = SequenceNode(10, left=SequenceNode(5, left=SequenceNode(2), right=SequenceNode(6, right=SequenceNode(7))),right=SequenceNode(15, left=SequenceNode(11)))
print('Tree length is', len(tree))

>>>
Tree length is 7
```

this still isn’t enough for the class to fully be a valid sequence. Also missing are the `count` and `index` methods that a Python programmer would expect to see on a sequence like list or tuple. It turns out that defining your own container types is much harder than it seems.

To avoid this difficulty throughout the Python universe, the built-in collections.abc module defines a set of abstract base classes that
provide all of the typical methods for each container type

```python
from collections.abc import Sequence

class BadType(Sequence):
	pass

foo = BadType()

>>>
Traceback ...
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class BadType with abstract methods __getitem__, __len__
```

When you do implement all the methods required by an abstract base class from collections.abc, as I did above with SequenceNode, it provides all of the additional methods, like index and count, for free

When you subclass from these abstract base classes and forget to implement required methods, the module tells you something is wrong

```python
class BetterNode(SequenceNode, Sequence):
	pass

tree = BetterNode(10, left=BetterNode(5, left=BetterNode(2), right=BetterNode(6, right=BetterNode(7))),right=BetterNode(15, left=BetterNode(11)))
print('Index of 7 is', tree.index(7))
print('Count of 10 is', tree.count(10))

>>>
Index of 7 is 3
Count of 10 is 1
```

The benefit of using these abstract base classes is even greater for more complex container types such as Set and MutableMapping, which have a large number of special methods that need to be implemented to match Python conventions

Beyond the collections.abc module, Python uses a variety of special methods for object comparisons and sorting, which may be provided by container classes and non-container classes alike

- Inherit directly from Python’s container types (like list or dict) for simple use cases
- Beware of the large number of methods required to implement custom container types correctly
- Have your custom container types inherit from the interfaces defined in collections.abc to ensure that your classes match required interfaces and behaviors
